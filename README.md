# Reflow Toaster Oven Controller

JAG 01/01/2012 0820 EST (GMT-0500)

### Introduction

This is a modification of the SparkFun Toaster Oven Controller to control my 2 Quartz Infra-red element 1200 watt 120VAC toaster oven.  Program #1 is for Tin/Copper/Silver Lead-Free solder paste and Program #2 is for standard Lead/Tin solder.

### Goals

The goal of this project was to create a reflow soldering oven I could use for my DIY SMD component projects.
 
### Status

This project is complete at this time, the source code is located in the Andy-Toaster directory and the latest source file for the PIC 16F88 is ToasterControl_v2.19c.C

The KiCAD schematic information is located in the Andy-Toaster/design directory and the instructions on how to use the original files (along with my version) can be found in the Original-Sources directory.

### Changes

Please send any changes that you make to Reflow-Toaster back upstream to Andy Goss' copy at https://github.com/DeuceEFI/Reflow-Toaster.
